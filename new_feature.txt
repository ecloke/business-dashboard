A brief summary is that, currently i have a google sheet that is already automatically updated, the data from there i can get number of clicks, impressions, amount spent, cost per lead from meta, google and so on. so basically i want to link this and also hubspot data together. 

for the first changes i want to make is that. i want to have a menu to change to different dashboard view, so by default is the one we already have we can called it Leads Overview. 

then i want another one can call it Marketing ROI.

so in this marketing ROI,  few data points i want, which all can be get from either the google sheet or hubspot, each of these data points i want total and also the breakdown by channel
1. Total spend, and total spend for each channel, which is in the google sheet
2. total leads generated also can get from the google sheet 
3. cost per conversion is basically spend/ leads
4. conversion rate = leads / number of click, clicks can also get from the gsheet
5. CTR = clicks / impressions, impressions can also get from the gsheet
6. clicks

So for this dashboard i also want to be able to filter by a date range

i think we can start off with this first. In terms of where to get the data within the gsheet, that we can do later, but at least i want to be able to connect to my gsheet
